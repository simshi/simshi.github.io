title: Thinking in Makefile
tags: makefile, make
----

It has been a while, many colleagues asked me on building issues of C/C++ components building, most of them are makefile related. During solving them, I found most of my colleagues have misunderstanding of makefile, makefile is so extraordinary in their eyes.

## What Problems It Solves?

> 'What the purpose of makefile?', I asked on of my colleague.

> 'To build software components?', he said.

> 'Then why don't you use shell scripts or even Python?', I said,

> 'Oh, I get it, incremental build!'
